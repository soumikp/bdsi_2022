The resources in this repository have been used in the course Statistics 102 in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University and are based on  the text Introductory Statistics for the Life and Medical Sciences (https://github.com/OI-Biostat/oi_biostat_text). Instructors may find the following sections useful.

*Lecture Slides*

Lecture slides from 2020 are provided, including the source files. The slides closely follow the organization of the textbook, with exception of inference being directly introduced with the t-distribution (in the text, the z-distribution is initially used for one-sample confidence intervals). 

Statistics 102 is taught in a semi-flipped format; in a 75 minute class session, the first 20-30 minutes are used for lecture, while the rest of the time is for students to work through applied lab exercises. Students work together on problems and the class reconvenes regularly to discuss answers.
